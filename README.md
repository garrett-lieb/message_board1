# <Message_Board>
## Description
Our website is a forum where users can log in to an account and post/view/comment on technology related queries and conversation. They will also be able to create their own avatars and usernames, passwords etc. Currently, we are calling it message_board or BridgeIT but havenâ€™t settled on a finalized name.
- We wanted to create a forum that could act as a resource for people with technology related questions.
- As individuals that have experienced various technological issues, we have collectively agreed that the internet is lacking a robut resource for all your tech troubleshooting or general discourse needs.
- BridgeIT acts as the ideal repository for the answers to all your technology, audio/visual and video questions or musings.
- Collectively as a group we learned a lot about making sure to work on things individually but also communicating about what we were specfically working on in order to ensure we don't overwrite each other.
